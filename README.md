# RustDMA-Hacks
A little DMA cheat for Rust. Some basic functions. A basic and easy to update SDK.

As Facepunch are claiming to take a heavier stance against content that infringes upon their copyright; I have removed the images of the cheat from the repo. It no longer contains any media from their game, therefore no more copyrighted material.
The entirety of the code in this repo is from the credited parties.
